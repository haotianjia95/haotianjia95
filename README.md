# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Haotian Jia, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tufts University. My research, supervised by Professor Marc Hodesï¼Œ focuses on the momentum and mass transfer process inside nanoporous media (i.e., aerogels) experiencing the Knudson effect. I study the transport phenomena using the tools of applied mathematics. I earned my B.S. in Machine Design & Manufacturing and Automation from Beijing Forestry University (BJFU) in July 2018 and joined Professor Marc Hodesâ€™s group at Tufts as a research assistant in March 2019. My research interests lie in using the tools of applied mathematics to understand and solve the momentum, heat, and mass transfer problems in the engineering field.

I have also worked on developing an apparatus to measure the permeability of nanoporous media aerogels using redundant methods and demonstrating mass transfer enhancement of the ambient-pressure freeze drying of aerogels experiencing the Knudsen effect through jet impingement. Currently, I am working on two projects: using photoresponsive surfactants and light to induce Marangoni stress and enhance flow lubrication on superhydrophobic surface microchannels, and using asymptotic expansion to solve the flow field of a vapor and liquid phase in an axial groove heat pipe problem. This includes adding first-order corrections to previous work done by Hodes et al. In the summer of 2022, I traveled to Imperial College London through the Tufts Global Research Assistant Program and collaborated closely with Dr. Michael Mayer and Professor Toby Kirk at Imperial College London on these two projects, respectively.
